# Changelog

## 0.1.0

First release.

- `toMatchPerceptually`: screenshot assertions judged by CIEDE2000 colour difference, with
  `toHaveScreenshot`'s baselines, update modes, stable-screenshot loop and report attachments.
- `toBePerceptuallyNear`: the same comparison for pixels read back from a canvas.
- Anti-aliasing and sub-pixel shift tolerance, each replaceable or switchable off.
- Speed and accuracy benchmarks against pixelmatch, Playwright's experimental comparator and
  looks-same.
