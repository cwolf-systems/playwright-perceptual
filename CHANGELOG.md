# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Playwright 1.64's `default` update mode is supported, and `missing` follows it there: a missing
  baseline is written and the test fails in `default`, and passes in `missing`, as with
  `toHaveScreenshot`. With Playwright before 1.64, `missing` still writes and fails. `UpdateMode`
  gains `'default'`; `matchSnapshot` callers who passed `'missing'` to get a failing write should
  pass `'default'`.
- Source maps carry the TypeScript sources, so stack traces and debuggers show them.
- The matchers' types are exported: `PerceptualMatchers`, `ToMatchPerceptually` and
  `ToBePerceptuallyNear`.

## 0.1.0

First release.

- `toMatchPerceptually`: screenshot assertions judged by CIEDE2000 colour difference, with
  `toHaveScreenshot`'s baselines, update modes, stable-screenshot loop and report attachments.
- `toBePerceptuallyNear`: the same comparison for pixels read back from a canvas.
- Anti-aliasing and sub-pixel shift tolerance, each replaceable or switchable off.
- Speed and accuracy benchmarks against pixelmatch, Playwright's experimental comparator and
  looks-same.
